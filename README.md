## 🎯 Quoted Identifier Handling

When outputting to CSV, TXT, or DAT formats, you can control how fields are quoted:

### 📋 **Quoted Identifier Handling Options**

- **🔧 Standard** (Default): Uses minimal quoting - only quotes fields that contain special characters like commas, quotes, or newlines. This is the most common and compatible option.

- **📝 All Fields**: Quotes every single field in the output, regardless of content. Useful when you need consistent formatting or when working with systems that expect all fields to be quoted.

- **🚫 Never Quote**: Never adds quotes around fields, even if they contain special characters. Use with caution as this can create invalid CSV files if fields contain delimiter characters.

### 💡 **When to Use Each Mode**
- **Standard**: Best for most use cases and maximum compatibility
- **All Fields**: When you need consistent formatting or target system expects quoted fields
- **Never Quote**: Only when you're certain your data doesn't contain delimiter characters
